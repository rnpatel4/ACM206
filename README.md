# ACM206
Code for ACM 206: Monte Carlo Methods for Scientific Computing

## Course Description
This course introduces Monte Carlo methods with applications in Bayesian computing
and rare event sampling. Topics include Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Gibbs
samplers, Langevin samplers, MCMC for infinite-dimensional problems, convergence of
MCMC, parallel tempering, umbrella sampling, forward flux sampling, and sequential
Monte Carlo. Emphasis is placed both on rigorous mathematical development and on
practical coding experience.
